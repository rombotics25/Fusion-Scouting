# Fusion Scouting
 a scouting app for frc tournaments. made by fusion corps 6672

 # Purpose
we were tired of looking for other (high quality) scouting apps 
that we just decided to make our own.
This one is based on 3 design principles:

    1) Work Offline
    2) Work on Mobile and PC
    3) Reliably transfer data to server

# TO USE

first, download main.html and open it on whatever device you please.
next, following the provided key, input your string of characters 
for that match.
# REMEMBER: THE FIRST TWO DIGITS ARE THE MATCH NUMBER AND THE NEXT FOUR ARE THE TEAM NUMBER
once you are done, download info.txt and transfer that to the parsing machine.
put both info.txt and parse.py in the same directory and run parse.py. it will generate a csv file
afterwards.
